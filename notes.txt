Q: Hashing for anonymity- I'm not totally familiar with this- what's the benefit of this over erasure?
Possible A: Equality checks are still possible on the data. Original data can be traced back to the anonymised hashed data.
    However, the anonymity offered is limited, original data can often be recovered from datasets with hashed anonymization.
    So perhaps just total replacement of the personal data would be best.


If we want to update old product info when we receive a newer version, we can do this by maintaining a key-value store, eg we can put it in a dict, or if needed, into redis.
We might also end up loading it into a RDBMS and doing the updates there.
I have skipped this since there's currently no requirement to do so.

Possible next step- use pySpark for streaming input into the etl process.

Could make customer 'last_change' into a datetime.

# TODO support continuous processing, rather than batch reading
